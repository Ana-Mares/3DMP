# Final Project - Spring Car

<b>Task:</b> Seeing how important it is to understand the meaning of Rapid Prototyping, the
Final Project consists of creating a prototype of a specific mechanism.

The final project that I chose for the 3DMP Course is a Spring Car, which I need to model starting from the following sources: <br>
	a.	[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX1OS6-TNw8&feature=youtu.be) <br>
	b.	[Thingiverse design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3328754) <br>
	c.	[MyMiniFactory design](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-dual-mode-spring-motor-rolling-chassis-26862) <br> <br>
	My direct reference was the MyMiniFactory design.

In this directory, you can currently find: <br>
a. The [canvases](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/Canvases) I made for the project. <br>
b. The [f3d files](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/f3d%20files) showing my progression over time. 

My project is a spring car. It works based on friction, which triggers the spring. The spring changes its form a little bit and, when the car is places on the ground, without being touched, it will want to go beck to its initial state, therefore making the car move forwards.

## Checkpoint 1
Tasks:
1. Create a new folder, in your 3DMP GitHub repository, with the name of your mechanism. Inside of it, make sure you have the canvases and the .f3d file of your project, and a short description of the mechanism (the readme).
2. Divide your project into components. Before designing the mechanism, create an empty component for each part of your project. This will help you to organize your project and understand how to make it step by step. (Course 8.5 video shows you how to do that)
3. Do the tasks established with your teaching assistant at the Office Hours. Also, redo the canvases if your teaching assistant asked you to.

Luckily enough, my canvases were good to go so I didn't have to redo them. 
The first thing I did was to make an empty component for each of the pieces in my design. For the first three components made (the left and right chassis and the large gear idler, I made additional canvases to help me in Fusion. After that, I figured out that it would be easier to just sketch in Fusion, without any more canvases. I measured my dimensions based on the .stl files from MyMiniFactory, in an attempt to be as close to reality as possible. I modelled around half of the components for my project, which can be seen from the [f3d file](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/blob/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/f3d%20files/Spring%20Car%20progress%2010.05.f3d) uploaded on the 10th of May, before the office hours. 

## Checkpoint 2
Tasks:
1. Do the tasks established with your teaching assistant at the Office Hours.
2. Update the .f3d file.
3. Update the readme, describing the current progress.
4. Any extra work will be rewarded (we encourage you to design as much as you can regarding that in the last week you will have other exams and it will be hard to work on this project as well)
For this week, I continued modelling the components and making the necessary adjustments and fixes regarding positioning or dimensions (which was quite troublesome), making sure everything is perfectly in place and ready to be 3D printed. I added all the remaining components and also appearance, as you can see from this [f3d file](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/blob/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/f3d%20files/Spring%20Car%20progress%2018.05.f3d). <br>
I also took time to update the README file, so that my progression over time is more clear.
