# 3DMP

This the the repository for the 3D Modeling and Printing Course held at the University of Bucharest, containg my homework and projects related to it. The programs used for this course are [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) and [Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).


Each Homework has its specific folder, while each exercise/project has a unique subfolder, which contains stl objects, f3d files and at least one printscreen of the slicer window.
