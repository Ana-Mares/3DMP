## Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms

<b>Task</b>: Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (We recommend to model them on your own as well)

~~ The two mechanisms modelled following the course are: <br>
		a. [Crank and Slotted Link Mechanism](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Homework%20%234/Rotational%20to%20Linear%20Motion%20and%20Vice-Versa%20mechanisms/Crank%20and%20Slotted%20Link)<br/>
		b. [Slider Crank Mechanism](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Homework%20%234/Rotational%20to%20Linear%20Motion%20and%20Vice-Versa%20mechanisms/Slider%20Crank%20Mechanism)<br/> <br>
