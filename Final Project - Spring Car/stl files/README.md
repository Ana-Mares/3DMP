# Final Project - Spring Car
## stl files

Here you can find the stl files for my project. <br><br>
The first file contains the assembly as a whole, for an easy overview of the car.
The others are separate stl files for each component needed (well, minus the wheels, which are four in total, but it would've been redundant to save 4 stl files when the wheels are symmetrical - as you can see in the file with the whole assembly; of course, if 3D printed, it is needed for each of the wheels to be added twice).
