## Thingiverse Model

Task: Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Slice it for 3D printing
and make a screenshot of the slicer window with the sliced object and the
selected option. Think of an useful improvement. If youâ€™re happy with the
new design, upload it as a remix of the original.

I downloaded a model of a phone case and gave it a few modifications, like changing the size of the fingerprint scanner's cutout and adding the decorative element(the heart) on the backside of the case. I also changed the cutout for the cameras, but that ended out giving me a lot of trouble, as there remained some empty spaces in the case and nothing seemed to work to fix them (and believe me, I tried), so I reversed to the original camera cutout, at least for now.
