## Two-wheels Mechanism

### Task:
  
Choose a mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion: <br>
a. https://tinyurl.com/y8zgkzjq <br>
b. https://tinyurl.com/ycxhnskp <br>
c. https://tinyurl.com/ycc3mrls <br>
d. https://tinyurl.com/ybxq84ko <br>
e. https://tinyurl.com/y9uww3b8 <br>
f. https://tinyurl.com/y94sx6om <br>
g. https://tinyurl.com/y7jvyma3 <br>
h. https://tinyurl.com/ydabljd6 <br> 
Divide the mechanism into components. Use Fusion Rule Number 1. Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints,
contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your
project. Create a stand for the mechanism (like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos) so they will not levitate. Add joints and create a motion study. Add appearances and render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well) <br>


<br>I chose the [sixth mechanism](https://tinyurl.com/y94sx6om) from the list. My version of it has a little more personality, as I wanted to delete some of the material in order to be more efficient and print less.
