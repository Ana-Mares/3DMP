## Scene With Twisted Column

Create a scene with a twisted column on a polygon surface (Fig. 3.1) <br> <br>
a. Use polygons tool to create the base (3DMP Lab #5.1) <br>
b. Replace the top face of the base with a custom surface to create the specific landscape for the column (3DMP Lab #5.5) <br>
c. Create a twisted column (Fig. 3.2). Use sweep for the body of the column (3DMP Lab #5.4) and loft for its bottom and top part (3DMP Lab #5.2 and 3DMP Lab #5.3) <br>
d. Add appearance on the model, render it, and make a photo of the render (3DMP Course #3.9 and 3DMP Course #3.10)  <br>
