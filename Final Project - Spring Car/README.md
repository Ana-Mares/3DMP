# Final Project - Spring Car

<b>Task:</b> Seeing how important it is to understand the meaning of Rapid Prototyping, the
Final Project consists of creating a prototype of a specific mechanism.

The final project that I chose for the 3DMP Course is a Spring Car, which I need to model starting from the following sources: <br>
	a.	[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX1OS6-TNw8&feature=youtu.be) <br>
	b.	[Thingiverse design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3328754) <br>
	c.	[MyMiniFactory design](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-dual-mode-spring-motor-rolling-chassis-26862) <br> <br>
	My direct reference was the MyMiniFactory design.

In this directory, you can currently find: <br>
a. The [canvases](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/Canvases) I made for the project. <br>
b. The [f3d files](https://github.com/Ana-Mares/3DMP/tree/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Spring%20Car/f3d%20files) showing my progression over time.
